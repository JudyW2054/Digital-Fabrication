<h3>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Model and 3D print something</h4>

This week I 3D printed and touched up a smaller sized model of the main structure of my project. As shown above. I wanted an idea of what it might look like as well as the angle, how stable the structure was and to help me visualize what additions I wanted/were feasible. I now know my legs are not very stable so I will have to redesign them, and I now know I want to add a component that allows me to adjust the angle of the stand.

As shown above and below I also 3D printed a casing with screw holes for my sensor so I could hold it in place. I realized I need to work more on the depth of the box as I made it too deep and something to stabilize it since it moves back and forth. Otherwise the dimensions and screw holes worked well.

As shown above, I programmed a sensor to work and send me how far a given object is away in mm. You can see the values change from 1196 to around 7-8 as I move my hand closer. This fits into my project as I will set a certain value to be the point where the sensor will send a signal to flip the page.

Above are pictures of my scan, I scanned my airpods case with an app on my phone called polycam. Below are pictures of my fusion sketches.
